When interacting with the **Fapshi Payment API**, it‚Äôs important to understand how the system responds to different types of requests. This helps in properly handling errors and managing successful transactions within your application.

## ‚úÖ Successful Requests

Any successful request made to the API will return an HTTP **status code of `200`**, indicating that the operation was processed correctly.  
The content of the response body will vary depending on the endpoint you called, but you can always expect structured data in a JSON format.

**Example response for a successful request:**

```json
{
  "message": "Request successful",
  "link": "https://checkout.fapshi.com/payment/685ac112ea66cd72c5e6cf1e",
  "transId": "ll7J2fl4",
  "dateInitiated": "2025-06-25T11:34:04.450Z" 
}
```

## ‚ùå Failed Requests

If something goes wrong, Fapshi will return a **4XX HTTP error code**, depending on the nature of the issue:

- **400** ‚Äì Bad Request (e.g., missing or malformed parameters)
- **403** ‚Äì Forbidden (e.g., invalid credentials)
- **404** ‚Äì Not Found (e.g., resource doesn‚Äôt exist)

The body of the response will always contain a `message` field that gives a clear explanation of the failure reason.

**Example error response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API credentials"
}
```

<Warning>
Make sure to always read the `message` field of the response to determine the reason for failure and guide your debugging process.
</Warning>

## üîÅ Request Formatting Guidelines

To avoid unexpected failures, keep in mind the following formatting rules:

- All request bodies must be **JSON encoded**.
- **GET requests must not contain a body**. If you include a body in a GET request, the API will immediately return an error.

<Note>
You can find SDK implementations of all API endpoints in different programming languages in our [GitHub SDK repository](https://github.com/Fapshi/SDKs).
