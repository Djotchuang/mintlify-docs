To successfully access any of Fapshi’s developer endpoints, you must include valid **API credentials** in every request. These credentials authenticate you and ensure secure access to Fapshi services.

## Overview

API credentials consist of:

- `apiuser` – your unique API user identifier  
- `apikey` – a secret key that acts like a password

These two parameters must be included in the **headers** of your HTTPS requests. If omitted or incorrect, the API will return an authentication error.

## How to Use Credentials in Requests

Include the `apiuser` and `apikey` in the header of every API call like so:

**Headers:**

`apiuser: YOUR_API_USER`

`apikey: YOUR_API_KEY`


This applies to both **sandbox** and **live** environments.

## Security & Responsibility

<Warning>
Your `apiuser` and `apikey` combination is essentially your **username and password** for the Fapshi API. Never share them or expose them in client-side code (like in JavaScript running in the browser). You are **fully responsible** for any misuse of your credentials.

Misuse of API credentials that results in violations of Fapshi's [Terms & Conditions](https://fapshi.com/en/terms-and-conditions) or [Privacy Policy](https://fapshi.com/en/privacy-policy) may lead to account suspension or permanent deactivation.
</Warning>
