Fapshi provides two separate environments for developers:

- **Sandbox (Test) Environment**
- **Live (Production) Environment**

Each environment is designed to serve a specific purpose and requires its own credentials and base URL.

## 1. Sandbox Environment (Test Mode)

The **Sandbox environment** is used for testing and development. It allows you to explore how the Fapshi API works **without using real money**.

Although no real transactions occur, the API behaves **exactly like the live environment**, ensuring a seamless transition from testing to production.

### Key Features

- No real funds involved
- Identical API behavior as live
- Separate credentials and base URL
- Ideal for development and integration testing

### Sandbox Base URL

https://sandbox.fapshi.com


### Simulating Payments

When testing local payment methods (e.g., Mobile Money), you can **simulate success or failure** depending on the number used.

### Test Numbers Table

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Status</th>
      <th align="left">Provider</th>
      <th align="left">Test Numbers</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">✅ Success</td>
      <td>MTN Cameroon</td>
      <td>670000000, 670000002, 650000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Orange Cameroon</td>
      <td>690000000, 690000002, 656000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">❌ Failure</td>
      <td>MTN Cameroon</td>
      <td>670000001, 670000003, 650000001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Orange Cameroon</td>
      <td>690000001, 690000003, 656000001</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<Note>
If you use any number **not listed above**, the transaction outcome will be determined randomly.
</Note>

## 2. Live Environment (Production Mode)

The **Live environment** is where real transactions happen. To use this environment:

- You must have an [activated account](/en/guides/getting-started/activate-account)
- You must [create a service](/en/api-reference/create-a-service)
- You will receive unique **Live API credentials** for each service

### Live Base URL

https://live.fapshi.com


<Warning>
**Live API keys are sensitive.** You’ll only see your `apikey` once, so copy and store it safely. You can generate a new key if compromised — this will immediately revoke the old one.
</Warning>

## Switching From Sandbox to Live

When moving your application from testing to production:

1. **Replace your Sandbox credentials** (`apiuser` and `apikey`) with your **Live credentials**
2. **Switch the base URL** from: `https://sandbox.fapshi.com` to `https://live.fapshi.com`

3. **Double-check** your integration for live readiness

<Tip>
Once you switch to the live environment and update your credentials and base URL, you're good to go!
