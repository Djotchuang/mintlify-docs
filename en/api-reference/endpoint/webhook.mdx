A webhook is an API endpoint made available to external applications that can be called to notify your application whenever a significant event occurs. This allows your app to react or respond immediately to these events.

You can set a webhook URL per service on your Fapshi dashboard. When set, a **POST** request will be sent to this webhook URL whenever the status of a payment changes to:

- **SUCCESSFUL** — when a payment attempt completes successfully
- **FAILED** — when a payment attempt fails (usually on operator networks like MTN Mobile Money or Orange Money)
- **EXPIRED** — when a payment link expires after 24 hours without successful payment

The body of the webhook request will be the same as the response body returned when querying a payment status (`/payment-status/:transId`).

<Note> 
Your server should respond quickly to webhook requests to avoid timeouts. Fapshi sends only one webhook request per event, regardless of whether your server responds or not.
