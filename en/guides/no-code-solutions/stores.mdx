Your store is a unified view of products which you add to it. With a store, people can see all your products in one place. However, you need to activate your account to own a verified store – it's free!

## How to Add Products to your Store

<Tip>Anyone who visits your store can add any of your products to their cart, and place an order. You'll be able to see this on the "Orders" section of your dashboard.</Tip>

This is how to setup your store:

**Step 1**: Log into your dashboard and navigate to **More > Store > Store**.

**Step 2**: Click on the pen icon to edit your vendor (store) credentials (logo, phone number, address, description, etc).

**Step 3**: Access your products page and add products to your store.

**Step 4**: Copy your store's link and share so your customers can order your products.

<Warning>
Treat Your Customers Well!

Your customers can review, rate, or report your store. Their ratings on your store matter a lot because others will be compelled to buy from you if you're rated high, hence, endeavour to serve your customers well. Encourage your satisfied clients to leave a review and rating to boost your sales. If your store is reported, we will verify the claims and take appropriate actions. However, to avoid being reported, serve your customers well!
</Warning>

**Step 5**: When your customers access your store's link, they'll be able to add products to a cart and place an order. When they do so, you will receive a notification on your dashboard and an email.

<Note>Every order placed for products from your store will appear under the "Orders" section on your dashboard. You will also receive a notification. You have to confirm the orders before they can pay. Also, endeavour to deliver products to your clients in the shortest time possible for better customer service.</Note>

**Step 6**: Visit the **Orders** section of your dashboard to confirm their orders. It is also important that you discuss with the customer. When you confirm the order, an invoice will be sent to them. The invoice contains a payment link. The link will open a portal where they can fill in their payment details.

Step 7: When your client pays, he/she will receive a payment receipt through his/her email and can download the receipt.
