No need to have a website to start selling online! Simply create a Fapshi payment link and send to your customers to instantly receive your payment. Fapshi currently allows you to create simple payment links, donation links, and varied links. Each of these links have different use cases for which they are best suited. See the [How to know which link to choose](#how-to-know-which-link-to-choose) section below for details:

## Donation Link

This is best suited for donations, crowdfunding, group contributions, njangi's, and any form of payment that involves more than one person paying.

### How to Create a Donation Link

**Step 1:** Log into your dashboard and navigate to **More > Payments > Payment Link**.

**Step 2:** Click the "Create a link" button at the top right and select "Donation link".

**Step 3:** Fill in the required details; you can select a fixed amount for the donation or select the "let the donor decide" option so the donor can decide what amount to donate. Even so, you can optionally set a minimum amount for the donation.

<Info>If you select the "Show donations" option, donors will be able to see those who have donated or contributed before them, the date/time, and the amounts paid.</Info>

**Step 4:** Your payment link will be generated and you can copy and share with your donors!

**Step 5:** When donors click on the link, the Fapshi payment page will be displayed for them to pay.

**Step 6:** When someone pays, he/she will receive a payment receipt through his/her email and can download the receipt.

<Info>
If you're using the mobile app, the options are the same. Open the payment links tab, select **Collect donations** and follow the same steps.

## Simple Payment Link

Perfect for one-time payments, subscriptions with fixed prices, webinar fees, etc.

### How to Create a Simple Payment Link

**Step 1:** Log into your dashboard and navigate to **More > Payments > Payment Link**.

**Step 2:** Click the "Create a link" button at the top right and select "Simple link".

**Step 3:** Fill in the required details; you must input an amount. 

<Info>If you want to collect money for contributions, you should create a [Donation Link](#donation-link) instead. If what you're collecting money for has multiple fixed prices, create a [Varied link](#varied-payment-link).</Info>
