A product is anything you want to sell or be paid for; it could be electronics, fashion items, books, services, etc. Fapshi gives you the possibility to create products and sell them through a payment link.

<Tip>All payments are made directly on the platform, and can be seen on your dashboard. You can withdraw your funds at anytime through a [Payout](/en/guides/managing-payments/payouts).</Tip>

## How to Create your Product

**Step 1**: Log into your dashboard and navigate to **More > Store > Products**.

**Step 2**: Click the "Add a Product" button at the top right.

**Step 3**: Fill in the required details; make sure to upload a picture of your product. You can also add more pictures of the product by uploading to the product gallery.

<Note>On Fapshi, you cannot post products whose prices are less than **500 FCFA**. Also, the following product names are forbidden, i.e., you can't give your products these names: **"fapshi", "pending", "invoice", "donation", "payment link"**.</Note>

**Step 4**: Your product will be created; you can see its details on the Products page on your dashboard, from where you can copy and share its link.

<Info>You can add your products to your store (a unified view for your products). You can also preview your products, edit, or delete them.</Info>

**Step 5**: When your customers click on the product link, the product view and payment portal will be displayed from where they can pay.

**Step 6**: When your client pays, he/she will receive a payment receipt through his/her email and can download the receipt.
