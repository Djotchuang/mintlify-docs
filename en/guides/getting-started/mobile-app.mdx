## Limitations

The app is mostly for monitoring and managing your Fapshi account. [Developer features](/en/api-reference/) are not available in the app. You can use the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.fapshi.com) for more advanced features like API access, webhooks, and more. Likewise, the app only supports [Payment links](https://fapshi.com/en/products/payment-links) and [event ticketing](https://fapshi.com/en/products/iventily) for the [no-code solutions](/en/guides/no-code-solutions).

### Push Notifications

Push notifications are messages sent directly to a userâ€™s device from a mobile app. To enable push notifications from the app, you must allow notifications from Fapshi in the settings of your phone. You can customize which notifications you want to receive in the app settings. You can activate or deactivate notifications for payments to your services. To do this, go to wallet, select the service, and toggle the notifications on or off.

Types of notifications include:

- New payments (for payment links, event tickets, and services)
- Successful payouts
- Company updates/information
- Successful transfers

### Accept Payments

The app allows you to manage payment links and sell event tickets online, view their details, and track their performance. You can create new payment links and event tickets directly from the app.

To create a payment link, go to the **"Payment Links"** section, select the kind of link you want to create and fill in the required details. You can set the amount, description, and other parameters.
<Info>If you don't know which kind of link to select, check the [Payment links](/en/guides/no-code-solutions/payment-links) section.</Info> 

For event tickets, go to the **"Event Ticketing"** section and tap Create Event. Fill in the title and spot categories (all other fields are optional) and submit.

Tap on a payment link or ticket to share the link, view its details, edit, or track its performance.

### Manage Payments

You can manage payments from the **Wallet** screen of the app. Select the wallet tab to view all your services. From there, you can view your service balances, transfer funds between services, and view the transactions for a particular service.
<Note>To withdraw the money in your service, you have to transfer it to your main balance.</Note>


### Payouts

You can initiate payouts from the **Payouts** section of the app. Here, you can view all your payout transactions, including their status and details. To initiate a new payout, select the method **(MoMo, OM, or bank account)**, fill in the amount, PIN, and confirm.
<Note>Funds withdrawn via MTN MoMo or Orange Money are received instantly, while bank transfers may take up to two working days.</Note>


### Account Settings

You can configure basic account settings directly from the app. This includes setting your Fapshi PIN, submitting account details for activation, editing your profile, setting up two-step verification, and contacting support. Visit our [Help and Support center](https://fapshi.com/en/help-and-support) for guides on how to perform any of these actions.
