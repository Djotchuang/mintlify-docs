## Steps

1. **Visit the Signup Page**: Go to [The Signup page](https://dashboard.fapshi.com/register) or download the Mobile App for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fapshi) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ng/app/fapshi/id6443700859) and fill in your **username**, **email**, **phone number**, and **password**.
   - If you are using the mobile app, tap on "Don't have an account? Sign up" to register.
<Note>
    Note the following when creating your account:
    - Your username must have a minimum of 4 characters and a maximum of 40 characters, usernames can only have letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and spaces.
    - All payment receipts and relevant information on Fapshi are sent to your email, so, make sure you provide a valid email, preferably one you use very often.
    - We advise that you use your WhatsApp phone number for registration.
    - Your password must be at least six characters long.
</Note>

2. **Verify your Email**: To be sure that your email is valid, you will receive a verification email with a verification code. Copy and paste this code in the email verification box to verify your email address. Once this is done, you will be redirected to the login page.
   - If you do not receive the verification email, check your **Spam folder**. If you're using an iPhone, check the **Junk folder**. When you copy the code, please report the email as **"not spam"** so that subsequent Fapshi emails appear in your inbox instead.
   - If you still do not receive the email, you can request a new verification code by clicking on the **"Resend Code"** button on the Email Verification page.

<Warning>
    **DO NOT SKIP THE EMAIL VERIFICATION STEP!** If you do not verify your email, you will not be able to log in to your account.
</Warning>

Once your account is created, you can log in to [The Fapshi Dashboard](https://dashboard.fapshi.com).

<Danger>
If after five attempts you are unable to sign in, you won't be able to do so until after one hour. Thus, use the [**Forgot Password**](https://dashboard.fapshi.com/forgot-password) option in case you forget your password. This is to prevent phishing attacks on your account.
</Danger>
