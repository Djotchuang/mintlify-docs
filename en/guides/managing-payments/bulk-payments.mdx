## How Bulk Payments Work

Follow these steps to disburse funds in bulk:

### Step 1: Top Up Your Fapshi Account

Before making any payments, ensure your account has enough funds to cover the total amount to be sent. 

- Go to the **Topup** section of your dashboard.
- Add funds equal to or greater than the total disbursement amount.

<Note>You can top up using MTN Mobile Money, Orange Money, or via a bank transfer/deposit.</Note>

### Step 2: Prepare the Recipient List

Download the **CSV template** provided in the **Bulk Payments** section. Fill in the required fields for each recipient:

- Full Name
- Mobile Money Number
- Amount to be sent

<Warning>Ensure all numbers are valid and registered under MTN Mobile Money.</Warning>

### Step 3: Upload and Pay

Once your CSV file is ready:
