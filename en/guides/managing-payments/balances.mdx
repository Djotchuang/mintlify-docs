Fapshi gives you the possibility to manage your funds in the easiest way possible. Whether you're using the platform as a merchant or for personal purposes, understanding how your balances are structured is essential.

<Tip>If there are any disputes on your account, they will also appear on this page.</Tip>

## Balance Structure

There are two types of balances on Fapshi:

1. **Main Wallet Balance**
2. **Service-specific Balances**

### Main Wallet Balance

This is your **default wallet**. All payments received through **no-code solutions** such as:

- [Payment Links](/en/guides/no-code-solutions/payment-links)
- [Invoices](/en/guides/no-code-solutions/invoicing)
- [Event Ticketing](/en/guides/no-code-solutions/event-ticketing)
- [Products and Stores](/en/guides/no-code-solutions/products)

...are recorded in your **Main Wallet Balance**.

<Info>
You can view your wallet balance directly from the **Balances** tab in the [Fapshi Dashboard](https://dashboard.fapshi.com) or the **Wallet** tab on the mobile app.
</Info>

### Service-Specific Balances

If you're a developer or merchant using Fapshi services programmatically (via APIs, Plugins, or SDKs), each **service you create** has its own dedicated balance.

These balances are **independent**, meaning:

- Each service receives its own payments
- You can view the balance for each service separately
- You can **transfer funds** between services (useful for cash-in-pay-out use cases) or to your **main wallet balance** for withdrawal.

<Note>
This structure makes it easier to separate finances across different projects or use cases. 
To withdraw money from your service, you must transfer the money into your main balance.
</Note>

## How to View Your Balances

You can view both your **Main Wallet Balance** and your **Service-specific Balances** from the Balances tab:

- On Web: Go to **Dashboard > Balances**
- On Mobile: Tap the **Wallet** tab at the bottom of the app

Each service or balance will be listed along with its total funds and a history of recent transactions.

## Moving Funds Between Balances

You can **transfer funds**:

- From one service to another
- From a service to your **Main Wallet Balance** (for payout)

To do this:

1. Open the **Balances** tab
2. Tap on the service you want to transfer from
3. Tap **Transfer**
4. Select the destination and amount
5. Confirm using your Fapshi PIN

<Warning>
If you want to withdraw money you've collected via a service, you must transfer the funds into your main wallet balance.
</Warning>

## Notes

- Balances are displayed in **XAF (FCFA)**.
- You can withdraw your funds at any time via [Payouts](/en/guides/managing-payments/payouts).
