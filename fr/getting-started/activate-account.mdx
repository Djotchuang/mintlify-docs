<Tip>
  You can test the Fapshi API in test mode without activating your account. This allows you to integrate and test your application before going live. However, to start receiving real payments, you need to activate your account by completing the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process.

3. **Complete KYC Verification**: Fill in the required information for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. This will include uploading identification documents and providing business information.
4. **Submit for Review**: Once you have completed the KYC form, submit it for review. You will receive a notification once your account is activated.
<Note>Account activation is usually completed within 24 hours or less. If you do not receive an email stating whether or not your account has been activated after the said time, please, [contact support](https://wa.me/237658610472).</Note>

  <Accordion title='Error: Red Image Name appearing'>
    **Solution:** This error usually occurs when the image you uploaded is not in a supported format or is too large. The supported formats are JPG, JPEG, and PNG. If you see a red image name, it means the image is not valid. Please ensure that your images are in one of the supported formats and are not too large.
