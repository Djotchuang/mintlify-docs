<Info>
  You can test the Fapshi API in test mode without activating your account. This allows you to integrate and test your application before going live. However, to start receiving real payments, you need to activate your account by completing the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process.
</Info>

Follow these steps to activate your account:

1. **Log in to your Fapshi Dashboard**: Go to [Fapshi Dashboard](https://dashboard.fapshi.com) and log in with your credentials.
2. **Navigate to Account Settings**: Click the **"Activate Account"** button on your screen or click **Compliance** on the menu bar. If you're using the mobile app, navigate to settings and the tap **"Activate Account"**.
3. **Complete KYC Verification**: Fill in the required information for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. This will include uploading identification documents and providing business information.
4. **Submit for Review**: Once you have completed the KYC form, submit it for review. You will receive a notification once your account is activated.
<Info>Account activation is usually completed within 24 hours or less. If you do not receive an email stating whether or not your account has been activated after the said time, please, [contact support](https://wa.me/237658610472).</Info>
5. **Start Receiving Payments**: After your account is activated, you can start receiving live payments through Fapshi.
<Note>We recommend you test your integration in test mode before going live. Also, you may have to logout and login to your account to see the changes.</Note>

## Additional Information

- For the ID, we only accept *"JPG", "JPEG",* and *"PNG"* picture formats; make sure your pictures are in any of these formats. If they're not, you could use [this site](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-png) to convert them into any of the formats listed above. Also, please ensure the pictures are clear enough such that one can effortlessly see the details on them.
- If you're using an ID receipt, ensure to submit the part where the validity was extended (back of ID).
- Your business name is a unique identifier for your business. **Be sure to use the correct name as you will not be able to change it later**.

We advise that you put a phone number that can be contacted on WhatsApp.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Red Image Name appearing'>
    **Solution:** This error usually occurs when the image you uploaded is not in a supported format or is too large. The supported formats are JPG, JPEG, and PNG. If you see a red image name, it means the image is not valid. Please ensure that your images are in one of the supported formats and are not too large.
